Twilio demonstration as an introduction to JavaScript. To use, __make sure you have Node.js installed!__
```bat
git clone https://github.com/SBCompSciClub/Twilio-Demo

Before you run the code, create `authentication.json` and add in the following:
```json
{
    "sid": "<SID>",
    "token": "<TOKEN>"
}
```
`<SID>` and `<TOKEN>` can be found on google drive. _These files are not commited due to security reasons, and must remain that way! DO NOT COMMIT A FILE WITH THE SID/TOKEN INFORMATION_

Once you've followed ^ steps, run the script

```bat
npm start
```
